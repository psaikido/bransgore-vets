We would seriously recommend that new pet owners consider taking out _Veterinary Insurance_ because many people have little idea how expensive some conditions can turn out to be. From our point of view it is beneficial to be able to do the best for the sick animal without having the worry of restricted finances. It is worth shopping around and carefully reading the small print. Alternatively why not consider starting a savings plan for your dog?
