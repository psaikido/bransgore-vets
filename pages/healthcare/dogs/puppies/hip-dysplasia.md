This is a well-recognized developmental disease of the hip joints usually seen in medium to larger breeds of dog. There is a mismatch between the growth rate of the skeleton and the muscles resulting in distorted hip joints and early-onset arthritis. This disease can be related to many factors including genetics, excessive feeding or excessive exercise (particularly on slippery floors) as a puppy. It is therefore ideal to purchase a pedigree puppy from a breeder who has had the parents hip-scored, and to ensure the puppy does not become overweight or receive too much exercise below 12 months of age. (20-30 minutes gentle exercise twice daily is sufficient, along with play around the house).
