The more a kitten is handled when young, the more sociable he/she is likely to be when older. Similarly you are less likely to have problems with other pets if a kitten is introduced rather than an older cat. However obtaining an older cat from a rescue centre has much to recommend it and you can gauge its temperament and characteristics more accurately. Cats or kittens should not be allowed out until 10 days after the vaccine course has been completed.
