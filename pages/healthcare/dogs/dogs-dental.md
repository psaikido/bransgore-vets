It is becoming increasingly recognized that animals need their teeth brushed too! It should not really be surprising that many dogs and cats need dental attention by the age of 8 years when you consider very few will be regularly having their teeth brushed. Unfortunately, unlike us, animals need a general anaesthetic every time their teeth need attention and any one animal may need several treatments over a lifetime if the owner is unable or unwilling to brush the teeth. A dental procedure for an older animal can be quite a costly procedure particularly if special anaesthetics and blood tests are requested, so prevention is better than cure! _Any soft toothbrush can be used but enzyme based veterinary dog toothpaste is essential_.
