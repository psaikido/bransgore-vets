It is the law to microchip all puppies by the time they are 8 weeks old; a simple injection implants a microchip the size of a rice grain under the skin between the shoulder blades. Should the pet ever be lost and picked up by a vet, the RSPCA or Police a simple scan can identify the owner. If you change your address or take on a new dog, your details must be updated on the central register. This service costs around &pound;27.00.
