__Thank you for choosing Bransgore Vets__. Mrs Tara C. Zilic BVetMed MRCVS is pleased to act as veterinary surgeon for your domestic pets. I promise to take all reasonable care in using my professional skills to treat your pets and to keep my skills up to date. Here I set out the terms under which this service is offered.

__Office hours__ These are 8.30 am to 12.30 pm, 2.00-4.00pm Monday and Thursday and 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm Monday to Friday; 9.15 am to 11.45 am Saturday. Non-emergency work is carried out during normal office hours. Please help us to provide you with the appointment you want by giving us plenty of notice for non-urgent work.

#### Emergency Service
To safeguard your pets welfare I will ensure that an emergency service is available outside these hours 24 hours a day 365 days a year. Services provided outside office hours incur additional charges.

#### Confidentiality
The veterinary surgeon / client relationship is founded on trust and in normal circumstances I will not disclose to any third party information about a client or animal without either expressed or implied permission.

#### Payment
We accept payment by credit card, debit card and cash. All clients are required to pay for their pet's treatment at the time. Invoices for surgery, investigations and treatment carried out at Bransgore Vets should be paid for at the time of the consultation or on collection of the patient. Drugs, dressings and diets collected from Bransgore Vets should be paid for at the time of ordering or on collection.

#### Insurance
Insurance to cover veterinary fees in the event of illness or accident enables many clients to provide the very best treatment when the need arises. At Bransgore Vets we support the concept of veterinary fees insurance and undertake to complete claim forms free of charge. However, the contract of insurance is between the client and the insurance company and payment of veterinary fees is not dependent on acceptance or payment of a claim by the insurance company but subject to our normal payment terms as outlined above unless arrangements for direct payment by the insurance company have been agreed in writing.

#### Repeat Prescriptions
The general policy of this practice is to re-assess an animal requiring repeat prescriptions every 3 to 6 months, but this may vary with individual circumstances. The standard charge for a re-examination is &pound;26.66 but the examination can be carried out inclusive with annual vaccinations. If you require a written prescription, the standard charge is &pound;12.98 per script.

#### Non-payment
We reserve the right to pursue unpaid fees. Civil proceedings may be issued or the matter handed over to a debt collection agency. Any costs incurred will be added to the debt and interest added under The County Courts Act 1984 or subsequent legislation. We reserve the right to ask for cash payments or to refuse to carry out further work if payment is not made in accordance with these terms of business.

#### Cancellation
Twenty-four hours notice of cancellation is required. We reserve the right to charge 50% of the normal fee for the work booked where less than 24 hours notice is given.

#### Reminders
As an additional service to our clients we endeavour to send reminders for vaccinations when they fall due. However, the postal service is not 100% reliable and we cannot take responsibility for errors or omissions. It is the owner's duty to ensure vaccinations are up to date.

#### Application
These terms of business apply to all clients of Bransgore Vets unless varied in writing.

#### Complaints
We hope that you are satisfied with the efficiency and quality of our service. If, however, you are not please refer promptly to Mrs Tara C. Zilic MRCVS in writing. Account queries should also be notified to Mrs Tara C. Zilic MRCVS as soon as possible.
