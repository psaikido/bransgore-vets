It is becoming increasingly popular to microchip pets; a simple injection implants a microchip the size of a grain of rice under the skin between the shoulder blades. Should your cat ever become lost and be picked up by a vet, the RSPCA or Police a simple scan can identify the owner. It does not matter how often you change your address etc as your details can be changed on the central register.

Implantation of the microchip costs around &pound;25.
